//Factory pattern is most widely used.
//According to this pattern, you create an object factory that will create whatever object you may need
//Hides internal logic of creating the objects

//Disadvantages can be the complexity if this pattern
//& cannot just/simply refactor your code to use factory pattern, you'll need to think & implemented that in the first place
//i.e. Before you start Coding

//Essentially makes use of an interface which contains method definition
public class FactoryDemo {

    //For example, let's have a Computer Interface with a method commute()
    //See "Computer" Interface for this
